Download Helper:
    - Edit where the files are moved to. Ideally they would be moved out of the Download folder
      and placed in the correct location in the file system (EX: A pdf would be moved to ~Documents/PDFs, 
      a document would be moved to ~Documents/)

Weather:
    - Take a zip code as an argument and retrieve, sort the data. 
    - Send an SMS message to my phone each morning via Twilio.
