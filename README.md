# Python
All Projects i've done in python

# Scripts 
Folder dedicated to scripts I have written for various tasks

## Download Helper
This script looks at your downloads folder and then sorts it based on the file type.

## Weather
This script utilizes BeautifulSoup to scrape the data for the NOAA for my location.
It then parses it and prints out the weather report for the next week.
